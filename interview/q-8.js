// Programmers use the ternary operator for decision making in place of longer if and else conditional statements.

// The ternary operator take three arguments:

// The first is a comparison argument
// The second is the result upon a true comparison
// The third is the result upon a false comparison

// It helps to think of the ternary operator as a shorthand way or writing an if-else statement. Hereâ€™s a simple decision-making example using if and else:

int 
a = 10, b = 20, c;

if (a < b) {
    c = a;
}
else {
    c = b;
}

printf("%d", c);
