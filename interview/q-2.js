// The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf.

// The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not match are removed.

// The only difference is the filter() method search through all the elements while find() method search through all the child elements only.
