// what do you mean by dot notation ??

// What is the Dot Notation?
// In simple words, the dot (.) notation is a way to access the attribute and methods of each method of instances of different object classes. It is usually preceded by the object instance while the right end of the dot notation contains the attributes and methods.


var cat = {
    name: 'Moo',
    age: 5,
  };
  
  console.log(cat.name);

// what do you mean by bracket notation ??

// Bracket notation is another way to access a property of an object. To use bracket notation, write the name of the object, followed by brackets [] . Inside the brackets, write the property name as a string. Bracket notation, unlike dot notation, can be used with variables.

var dog = {
    name: 'Lady',
    friends: ['Moo','Bowie'],
  };

  console.log(dog['name'])
